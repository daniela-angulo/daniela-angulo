- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @daniela-angulo.
- :books: My academic interests are quantum optics, optics, and atomic physics. 
- :bike: I love cycling (watching and riding), swimming, reading big novels and politics.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently in a PhD in experimental quantum optics. I will upload codes that we use for analyzing our data or just small simulations that help us to understand our results.
