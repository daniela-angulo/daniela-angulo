- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @daniela-angulo.
- :books: My academic interests are quantum optics, optics, and education. 
- :bike: I love cycling (watching and riding), swimming, reading big novels and politics.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently in a PhD in experimental quantum optics. I will upload codes that we use for analyzing our data and small simulations that help us to understand our results. I'll also post python codes that I use to teach quantum mechanics and optics.
- :mag_right: I've been making my website recently [here](https://daniela-angulo.github.io/). It's still under construction.
